## Brief Abstract
Our research explores the interplay between climate change, wildfire evacuation patterns, and socioeconomic factors by analysing mobile phone data from the 2024 wildfires in Valparaíso, Chile. Using causal inference techniques, we examine how evacuation behaviours differ across socioeconomic groups, offering insights into the broader impact of wildfires on human mobility and community vulnerability.

Key findings include:
- Lower socioeconomic groups tend to stay away from their homes longer and reduce travel more significantly during evacuations.
- Initial movements were chaotic, but individuals gradually gravitated toward areas with similar socioeconomic conditions.
